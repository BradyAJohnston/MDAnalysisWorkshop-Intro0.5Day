# Blender and Molecular Dynamics Tutorial

This will be a _brief_ introduction to importing MD trajectories into the 3D animation software Blender, via Molecular Nodes.

An introduction to Blender's interface is covered in [BlenderInterface.md](BlenderInterface.md). Using Molecular Nodes to import trajectories into Blender is covered in [MolecularDynamics.md](MolecularDynamics.md).

Much more detailed tutorials and information are available on the [Molecular Nodes](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes) website.

TODO: before PR

- [ ] update the links to the workbooks
- [ ] move the blender related stuff into a Blender folder
- [ ] add explicit explanation and installation instructions related to Blender stuff and the notebooks
- [ ] google drive link to upload images / videos that were created during the tutorial


Outline for the workshop: 
- How to navigate the Blender interface
- Loading in a trajectory
- Doing an example render
- explain about rendering to video
- change the style
- adjusting the camera
- rendering & saving the example image

- example of the BNotebooks add-on, with Jupyter notebook running under the hood.
