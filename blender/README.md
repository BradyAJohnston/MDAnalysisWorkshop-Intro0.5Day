# Blender and Molecular Dynamics Tutorial

This will be a _brief_ introduction to importing MD trajectories into the 3D animation software Blender, via Molecular Nodes.

An introduction to Blender's interface is covered in [BlenderInterface.md](BlenderInterface.md). Using Molecular Nodes to import trajectories into Blender is covered in [MolecularDynamics.md](MolecularDynamics.md).

Much more detailed tutorials and information are available on the [Molecular Nodes](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes) website.
